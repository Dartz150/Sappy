<h1>Song Transplants</h1>

<p>Any game that uses the M4A engine to play back its music and sounds can be used in a song transplantation. This used to be a very big task, finding a song's header and hand-dumping each track. Then, you'd have to go through each track and edit every single pointer. One slip-up and the song wouldn't work.</p>

<p>Now all you have to do between exporting and importing the tracks is to edit the tracks' <a href="trackbytecode.html#voice">VOICE</a> commands (most tracks having only one of those), and picking a nice <a href="glossary.html#voicegroup">voice group</a> that more or less suits your needs.</p>

<p>The following things must be done for a proper song transplant:

<ul>
	<li><a href="transplantexport.html">Export tracks</a></li>
	<li><a href="transplantedit.html">Edit voice commands</a></li>
	<li><a href="transplantimport.html">Import tracks</a></li>
</ul>
