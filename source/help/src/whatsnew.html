Sappy 2006: What's New</td></tr></table>

<h1>What's New</h1>

<p>

<b>From 1.1 to 1.2</b>
<ul>
<li>Super-fast sample loading - ask for details if you dare!</li>
<li>Anti-earbleeding system to disable unneeded but ear-piercing sounds like some in Final Fantasy 4.</li>
<li>MIDI support like in the old Sappy.</li>
<li>MIDI mapping editor.</li>
<li>MIDI export, thanks to Drag for fixing it.</li>
<li>Ability to choose which MIDIOUT device to use.</li>
<li>Various bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

<b>From 1.0 to 1.1</b>
<ul>
<li>Idiot-proof exporters. You'll be notified when you misread "file pattern" for "file name" or "path name".</li>
<li>Non-braindead assembler. It no longer fails on pointers.</li>
<li>Volume control slider. Responds to keyboard (if it has focus) and mouse wheel.</li>
<li>WM_APPCOMMAND support. If you have dedicated media control buttons on your keyboard, Sappy will listen to them.</li>
<li>Sound loading on byte arrays instead of character strings, as urged by Bouché.</li>
<li>Feedback while loading a song to play.</li>
<li>Rudimentary Sappy Classic-style MIDI support with equally rudimentary GameBoy Classic mode and instrument remap.</li>
</ul>

<b>Wishlist</b>
<ul>
<li>Support for more MIDI controls.</li>
<li>Tempo fix for exports.</li>
<li>GameBoy Classic mode for the new driver.</li>
<li>Full sound loading fix. As of 1.1, only PCM waves are properly loaded. Tone generators are still loaded in strings.</li>
</ul>
