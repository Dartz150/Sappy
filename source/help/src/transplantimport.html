<h1>Import Tracks</h1>

<p>The Import Tracks dialog is a little more complex than the Export dialog. Select the track files you want to import in the list box, and enter three pointer values. Defaults are provided, these are the currently selected song's pointers.</p>

<p>Tracks are handled in the order they appear in the list box. To import a later-appearing file before an earlier-appearing file, rename them in Explorer to change their sorting order. In-track pointers are recalculated when needed.</p>

<p>When importing is done, Sappy will ask for confirmation to automatically change the Master Song Table to reflect your changes.</p>
